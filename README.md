# GNOME Modular Settings Panel
I made this for my own latop which runs gnome. There were issues with defualt keyboard popping in touch mode, options for night light not showing up and rotation being buggy. These 3 extensions solve that problem.


## Features

This extension includes the following modules:

*   **Keyboard Toggle:** A simple button to show or hide the on-screen keyboard.
*   **Quick Settings Panel:** A dropdown menu with toggles for dark mode, night light, and grayscale, as well as a slider for night light temperature. It also allows you to set custom light and dark mode wallpapers.
*   **Rotation Lock:** A toggle to lock or unlock screen rotation.

## Setup

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
2.  Run the following command to install the extension:
    ```bash
    gnome-extensions install --force .
    ```
3.  Enable the extension from the Extensions application or by running:
    ```bash
    gnome-extensions enable modular-settings-panel@example.com
    ```
